Any data within subfolders has according metadata within the same subfolder. 

This data and metadata accompanies Cooling effect provided by urban parks minimally affected by historical legacies, Richmond et al. (In prep).

dataset: studyparks.csv
This dataset lists all parks used in our study. 
ParkOfficial: Official name as listed in City of Montreal documents or on Open Street Map
Name: Unofficial park name occasionally used throughout documents
ObjectID: placeholder column (not meaningful)
Established: Year that the park was established (or closest year as per historical documents)
PastLandUse: Land use type immediately prior to park establishment


dataset: trees_openrefine.csv
This dataset lists all trees measured during the 2022 field season. Spelling and typos were addressed using OpenRefine.
Park: park name
PlotID: plot ID (ParkCode-CanopyCode)
Date: date of sampling
Observers: people working on sampling for that plot, initials
TreeNumber: nth tree for that plot 
CommonName: common name of tree (if tree is dead, Dead is used here. If tree is unknown, Unknown is used here)
Genus: scientific genus name of tree 
Species: scientific species name of tree (if not sure, sp. is written)
DBH: diameter at breast height (cm), if tree has a DBH < 5 cm, categories of 1-3 and 3-5 are used to classify instead of measuring
Overstory/Understory: categorical variable assigned to each tree, determining if they are an overstory or understory tree 
Comments: any comments made in the field for a specific tree

TreeNumber: nth tree for that plot 
CommonName: common name of tree (if tree is dead, Dead is used here. If tree is unknown, Unknown is used here)
Genus: scientific genus name of tree 
Species: scientific species name of tree (if not sure, sp. is written)
DBH: diameter at breast height (cm), if tree has a DBH < 5 cm, categories of 1-3 and 3-5 are used to classify instead of measuring
Overstory/Understory: categorical variable assigned to each tree, determining if they are an overstory or understory tree 
Comments: any comments made in the field for a specific tree


dataset: Park.densiometer.csv
Dataset containing plot-level variables collected in the field but not used for analysis.
Park: park name
PlotID: plot ID (ParkCode-CanopyCode)
Date: date of sampling
Observers: people working on sampling for that plot, initials
GroundCover: general ground cover of plot (grass, cement, shrubs, etc)
VegetationLevels: how many vegetation levels are present in the plot (herbaceous, shrub, understory, overstory)
PastLandUse: past land use immediately prior to development
Coordinates: plot location (crs WGS 84)
Temperature: temperature and weather on day of sampling
DensiometerN: number of canopy openings in the North direction using a densiometer (multiply by 1.04 for % canopy cover)
DensiometerS: number of canopy openings in the South direction using a densiometer (multiply by 1.04 for % canopy cover)
DensiometerE: number of canopy openings in the East direction using a densiometer (multiply by 1.04 for % canopy cover)
DensiometerW: number of canopy openings in the West direction using a densiometer (multiply by 1.04 for % canopy cover)
Comments: any comments on plot made in the field 
Park size: size of whole park (ha) 
Established: Year that the park was established (or closest year as per historical documents)
Park age: 2022 - year of establishment	
Conservation area: is this plot in a conservation area?
Complexity: number of levels of complexity (aka vegetation levels)


dataset: mon_historical_for_boundaries.gpkg
This dataset was hand-drawn in QGIS using historical documents and satellite imagery, to outline the boundaries within our study parks of forested land.
Name: park name
PastLandUse: historical land use (forested)
geometry: polygon borders (crs = WGS 84)



dataset: mon_historical_mix_boundaries.gpkg
This dataset was hand-drawn in QGIS using historical documents and satellite imagery, to outline the boundaries of multiple different land-use types for parks that have multiple histories.
Name: park name
PastLandUse: historical land use
geometry: polygon borders (crs = WGS 84)


dataset: gps_sppts.gpkg 
This dataset is the coordinates of sampling points from summer 2022 recorded on the Garmin GPS.
Name = name of sampling plot 
geom = point coordinates (crs = WGS 84)


dataset: species_ranges.csv
This dataset indicates if tree species are native to the Eastern Temperate Forest, with data taken from Katie Philp's honours thesis.
Species Code: 4-5 letter code that indicates the species 
Scientific Name: full scientific name of the species
Common Name: common name of the species (in english, QC)
Native_ETF: is the species native to the Eastern Temperate Forest (yes/no)
Invasive: is the species invasive in Quebec (yes/no)
Origin source: where did the species originate from 
Ivasive Source: where did the invasive originate from (province or state or country)
Comments: extra comments
