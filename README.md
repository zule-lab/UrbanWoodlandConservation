## Abstract
While biodiversity conservation in urban areas is a topic of great interest, few studies have focused on the role that conservation areas and their associated management have for preserving urban biodiversity. Urban woodlands, which are patches of forest habitat confined within the city’s boundaries, offer a promising approach to evaluate the importance of conservation areas within cities. Here we examined the effect that a conservation status has on forest structure and composition across eleven urban woodlands in Montréal, Canada. Using field surveys we determined differences in biodiversity indices, canopy cover and complexity of the vegetation layers for urban woodlands with a conservation status (Nature Parks), and those without a conservation status (non-status woodlands). We found that Montréal’s urban woodland fostered similar levels of biodiversity regardless of conservation status. Similarly, all urban woodlands supported high proportions of native tree species despite differences in conservation status and associated management. The Nature Parks, however, had higher complexity within their vegetation layers and contained higher levels of invasive trees, particularly Rhamus Cartihca (Common Buckthorn). Our results suggest that both conservation areas and non-status woodlands play an important role in safeguarding urban biodiversity. While the high complexity in vegetation layers observed in the Nature Parks may provide habitat to native wildlife, these benefits may be limited by the high proportion of invasive trees.
